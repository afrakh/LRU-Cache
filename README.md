# LRU-Cache

The project based on the implementation of data structures and algorithm is a project in which we have 
to develop a LEAST RECENTLY USED CACHE(LRU). LRU is a type of cache that maintains a 
limited number of item, in which the least recently used item will be evicted in the case when the cache 
reaches its maximum capacity. To design such structure, the operations of get and put are implemented. 
The project is based on a user friendly interface by adding a GUI feature that shows the cache and 
allows user to save the cache for later use too by saving the current cache in a database. Moreover, the 
track of number of hits, misses, accesses, miss rate and hit rate has also been kept.
